            <p><h1>Philippines getting a grip on HIV</h1> </p>
            </header>
            <p> It has been over 6 years since the Philippines passed the RH Law - more formally known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10354).  The controversial law took over 30 years to pass and was intended to guarantee universal access to contraceptives, fertility control, sexual education, and maternal care.  However historical and necessary a measure, it has not been universally accepted - the Supreme Court suspended the efforts when the law received harsh criticism from religious groups saying the law violates the rights to free speech and religion.  

When it comes to family planning, and reproductive and sexual health education,  the Philippines continues to exhibit a conservative stance despite evidence based policies and programs that have been proven to prevent the spread of HIV.  Religious ferver, misguided policies, and barriers to access contraceptives and information, have led to a rapidly growing HIV epidemic in the country - a 3417% increase in 10 years.  
<p>Since March 2018, there have been 912 new HIV cases reported.  Of these cases, 94% (858) were male.  The Department of Health records show that 86% of the cases were from men who have sex with men (MSM) and 1% from intravenous drug users.  There is a tremendous sense of urgency from international agencies and donors to impede this health crisis and make HIV a priority, yet the Philippine government has neglected to adequately targeted high risk groups including MSM and the transgender community.  Neglecting to focus on the dire sexual health risk that MSM face may be another Catholic Church influenced decision as devout Christians and social conservatives believe that sex between males is the cause of HIV transmission.  
The estimated population of gay men and MSM in the Philippines is 531,500 with an HIV prevalence of 4.9% in Asia and the Pacific according to UNAIDS as of August 2017.   Because new infections in the past six years have doubled, the Philippines’ has the fastest growing HIV epidemic in Asia and the Pacific.

Legal obstacles and policy barriers are blocking access to condoms and keeping sexual and reproductive health education out of school curriculums.   The Church encourages “abstinence” over protection.   So where do young people get their information from?  The conservative sentiment in the philippines is such that many educators and lawmakers believe sexual health education should be placed in the hands of parents and not to be discussed in schools.  By keeping young people in the dark and placing the responsibility to discuss such matters solely on parents, the likelihood that conversations about sexual health, condoms, and HIV will occur is low, if it will occur at all.  Parents do not wish to discuss such topics with their children, and children do not care to speak about these issues with their parents.

Fortunately, there are many progressive individuals and organizations that recognize the urgent need to educate the Filipino people.  In May, Catriona Gray, Miss Universe -Philippines 2018, took her first HIV test to raise awareness about the importance of getting tested and to encourage others to come out and get tested at the “This is Me, Brave and Free mass HIV testing campaign organized by LoveYourself Inc.  In June, the first issue of GLU (Gays Like Us) was released- the Philippines’ first LGBTQ+ positive magazine.  The bilingual publication is free and focuses on raising awareness HIV and other issues that affect the LGBTQ+ community.  More importantly, publisher, Paolo Lorenzana wishes to celebrate the gay man’s journey, regardless of what that is and to show solidarity for the gay community by providing an outlet where conversations about gay sex and the issues and experiences that gay men experience are welcome and celebratory.  
</p>
<p>
It is clear that the movement toward destigmatizing HIV and providing support for those who are at risk, specifically the MSM community, are on the way, yet more must be done to make a significant impact.  Evidence based programs to reduce the spread of HIV must be implemented and high risk groups need to be targeted.  Filipinos must stand up for who they are, stand up for others and take a stand against ignorance by informing themselves and others about HIV, safe sexual practices, despite popular religious sentiment in order to slow the spread of HIV throughout the country.  Without the support of the church and the government to implement and guide appropriate policies like the RH Law the road will continue to be difficult but not impossible.
